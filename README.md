# From-Track-to-Data-Machine-Learning-with-Geospatial-Features-for-Formula-1-Race-Outcome-Modeling

A comprehensive spatial data science project that predicts Formula 1 race outcomes by integrating geospatial track features, driver performance analytics, and machine learning techniques.


## Overview

This project bridges geodetic engineering principles with data science to analyze Formula 1 racing through a unique spatial lens. By integrating geospatial circuit characteristics (latitude, longitude, altitude) with traditional racing metrics, this work demonstrates how physical geography influences competitive outcomes in motorsport.

**Key Objectives:**
- Predict race winners using geospatial and performance features
- Analyze how circuit geography affects racing outcomes
- Identify driver performance archetypes through clustering
- Map Formula 1's global expansion and competitive evolution

## Results

### Model Performance

**Championship Forecasting:**
- Accuracy: 97.7%
- Successfully predicted dominant drivers (Verstappen, Hamilton, Schumacher)

**Lap Time Prediction:**
- RÂ² Score: 0.34
- Moderate predictive capability, revealing circuit-specific variance

### Findings

**Geospatial Insights:**
- **Altitude Impact**: Negative correlation with fastest lap speeds (high-altitude circuits show reduced velocities)
- **Latitude Patterns**: Tropical circuits exhibit higher lap time variability due to temperature/humidity
- **Geographic Clusters**: European circuits show tighter performance clustering vs. equatorial venues

**Statistical Discoveries:**
- Grid position coefficient: -0.16 (p < 0.001) - qualifying advantage is crucial
- Progressive performance improvement from 1950s to present
- Four distinct driver archetypes: Dominant Champions, Midfield Specialists, Opportunistic Scorers, and Outliers

**Constructor Dominance Eras:**
- Ferrari dominance (2000s)
- Red Bull Racing supremacy (2010s-2020s)
- Mercedes hybrid era (2014-2020)
